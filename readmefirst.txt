To figure out how to use the programs, please open up the ftclient.py
and ftserver.py files in a text editor. The first several comment
lines of these files describe how to use them. PLEASE be sure to put
the ftclient.py and ftserver.py files in seperate directories, other wise
there is little point in using them.
